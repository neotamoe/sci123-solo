##Project Overview
**Science123 Quiz App** (final app name yet to be finalized) is a full-stack web application to complement learning in the Science123 course at Augsburg College.  Sci123 is a general education science course most often taken by students looking to fulfill their general education science credit needed for graduation.  

The goal of the app is to encourage learning outside of the classroom as students are engaged with food in everyday life (e.g. while cooking at home).  The app displays quiz questions based on the primary text “On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen” by Harold McGee.  Each question also provides a reference to the text to encourage students to learn more.  The quiz feature will be mobile-responsive.

##Solo Project
From Prime Digital Academy Website:   
**PROJECT-BASED LEARNING**   
Software engineers learn by doing—that’s why Prime dedicates the final third of the program to project-based learning. In this phase, you’ll have the chance to work a project of your own design as well as help a real-world organization solve a real-world problem. You’ll get a chance to dive into a project you’re passionate about and build an app from top to bottom on your own and you’ll learn how to be part of a successful software development team, practicing behaviors and techniques you’ll use every day as a working software engineer.    

Your solo project is an incredible opportunity to spend two full weeks sharpening your development skills while showcasing your passions. You’ll be working solo, but you’re far from alone. You’ll do daily “standup” meetings where you discuss what you’re tackling and get support where you need it from your peers and your instructors. In the end, this project will be an excellent tool to show prospective employers who you are and what you’re capable of."
